  The first step is to click on the MySQL file to download it. After that, I followed the prompts by selecting "Typical" and then clicking "Next" until the installation was complete.

I created a new folder named "PHP" on the C: drive in Windows. Next, I started the installation of the PHP software. I located the software file, right-clicked on it, and selected "Extract All." When prompted to choose a destination, I typed in "C:/PHP," and all the files were extracted to that folder. I accepted all prompts and continued through the installation process until it was finished..
